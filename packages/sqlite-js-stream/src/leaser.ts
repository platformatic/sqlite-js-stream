/**
 * Distributed leasing.
 *
 * When multiple replicas point at the same storage path, only one may be the
 * active writer at a time. A `Leaser` acquires a lease on the replica's storage
 * (a `lock.json` file / object); only the lease holder is the *primary* and may
 * write. Other replicas become idle *followers* that poll until the lease is
 * available.
 *
 * This mirrors litestream's `leaser.go`/`Lease` (a storage-agnostic interface)
 * and `s3/leaser.go` (a conditional-write S3 implementation). Acquire uses
 * `If-None-Match: *` when no lease exists and `If-Match: <etag>` (renew) or
 * `If-Match: <etag>` (release) otherwise, so a stale writer can never clobber a
 * live one.
